### Shopping List

The function **shoppingList** takes an array of strings:

```js
let shopping = ["Shampoo", "Conditioner", "Toothpaste"];
```

## Exercise

* Create a list of shopping items.
* You should use an unordered list: `<ul>`.
* Each item from the array should be in a `<li>` tag.
* All of your HTML should go inside the `<div>` with the id **"content"**.
